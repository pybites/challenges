##pomodoro-timer

Pomodoro Timer is a super simple Pomodoro Timer made for [PyBites Code Challenge 52](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/52/).

I wanted to make this the simplest possible solution.

In this case, the duration of the timer is hard coded to 10 minutes.

A datetime string is printed when the timer starts and end.

That's it!

##TO DO

Given the challenge is to simply make a timer this is okay. I obviously want to expand on this given the time:

- Customised times.
- Flask front end.
- Have a visual/audible alert when the timer is up.
- Pomodoro Counter (How many Pomodoro timers have you completed?)
