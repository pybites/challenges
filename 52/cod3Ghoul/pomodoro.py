""" PCC52 - Create your own Pomodoro Timer (24th of Sept 2018)
    Instructions + submit work: https://codechalleng.es/challenges/52
    
    The Challenge: 
    - Create a timer for a set duration (eg 20 minutes) that "alarms" or notifies you at completion.
    - Go a step further and allow the user to specify the amount of time the Pomodoro Timer goes for.
    - Further develop the app by allowing it to loop. That is, Pomodoro Time > break time > Pomodoro Time > break time.
    - Create a user interface if you have the time! PyGame or argparse perhaps? Maybe even make it web based with Flask or your other favourite web framework."""
