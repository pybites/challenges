# PyBites Challenges

Every Monday we release a challenge [on our blog](http://pybit.es). 
On Friday we publish one or more solutions.

The goals is to have us and our readers work on the solution during the week.

To keep it simple we don't accept pull-requests at this time. 
Just fork the repo and work on your solution locally:

	$ cd <challenge_number> 
	$ cp name-template name.py
	# code ...

If you want to share your solution just share your commit link in the comments of our blog (Monday post = questions / Friday post = solutions + feedback).

Check [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) how to keep your fork in sync with our repo.

Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition. 
We do of course strive to have good Pythonic solutions so any feedback is welcome, but do respect the newby / learner. 
Again, learning more + better Python is the main objective. We believe fixing challenges is a very effective way to achieve this.

Have fun!

Keep Calm and Code in Python!
