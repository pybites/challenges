# PyBites Code Challenges

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/pybites/challenges](https://badges.gitter.im/pybites/challenges.svg)](https://gitter.im/pybites/challenges?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Every Monday we release a code challenge [on our blog](http://pybit.es). 
End of the week we publish one or more solutions.

The goal is to have us and our readers work on the solution during the week.

To keep it simple we don't accept pull-requests at this time. 
Just fork the repo (at the top of this page) and work on your solution locally.

See [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for more details.

If you have questions or want to share your solution use the comment section of the [challenge (review) posts](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html).

Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition. 
We do of course strive to have good Pythonic solutions so any feedback is welcome, but do respect the newby / learner. 

Again, learning more + better Python is the main objective. 
We believe solving code challenges is a very effective way to achieve this.

Have fun!

Keep Calm and Code in Python!
