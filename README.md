# PyBites Code Challenges

Every beginning of the month we release [2 new code challenges](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html) and the reviews (PR submissions) of the ones of the last month.

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to get coding.

Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition.  Learning more + better Python is the main objective. Respect the newbie.

We believe solving code challenges is a very effective way to achieve this. Good luck and have fun!
