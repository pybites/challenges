# PyBites Code Challenges

Every month we release [2-4 new Python code challenges](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html) and a review post where we publish solutions and feature merged pull requests. 

Update 20th of December 2017: we launched our new [Code Challenges Platform](https://codechalleng.es/). Please start using it and let us know what you think! Used to the old instructions they are still [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md). 

You can read more about it [here](https://pybit.es/special-birthday-new-platform.html).

## Code of conduct

Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition.  Learning more + better Python is the main objective. Respect the newbie.

We believe solving code challenges is a very effective way to achieve this. Good luck and have fun!
