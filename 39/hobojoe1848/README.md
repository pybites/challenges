##My First Attempt at PyTest

So this is super basic.

I wrote a script an age ago that'll convert an ACTUAL list of text (not Python list []) to be a single string with each work separated by a space.

A nice simple script to write my very first PyTest against!

I do intend on writing a more advanced PyTest so will issue another PR against this submission later.

Time restraints meant I was only able to write the one simplistic test against this script. It took me ages to get right though so definitely happy I gave this a crack!
