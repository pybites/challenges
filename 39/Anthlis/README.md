##A First Attempt at PyTest Fixtures and Parametrization (using PyCharm)

![Python version][python-version]

I found the #100daysofcode tutorials shown using Vim quite difficult to follow. 

So I looked online for other tutorials knowing to look for pytest fixtures and parametrization.

The tutorial I have used for this is taken directly from the [PyCharm 2019.1 help files](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/pytest.html)

This challenge served two purposes for me:
1. Follow a very simple pytest tutorial using PyCharm
2. Complete my first ever Pull Request.

I intend on writing a more advanced PyTest so will issue another PR against this submission later. 

When I've finished the #100daysofcode I'll read Python Testing with Pytest by Brian Okken. TDD looks interesting and I'm keen to learn more!
