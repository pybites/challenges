# Challenge 11
## by SimplyKyra

The first time through this challenge I forgot we were supposed to make generators. Once I completed it 
I check out other files and realized I completely missed the point. Instead of deleting it all I chose 
to create a new file and start over leaving the first. Since generators are needed while working with 
large amounts of data I figured it was great having both files.

simply_answer_without_generators.py is the first file I worked on and has no generators.

simply_generator_for_fun_and_profit.py is the second one I worked on that contains generators.
