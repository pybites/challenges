This is the very first script I wrote!

I wrote it as a joke to provide random troubleshooting steps for my team and I on those occasions where we just couldn't figure out what was wrong with a machine.

Refactoring wise, I chose NOT to add any new features (refactoring, not development) and have just gone through and structured everything more Pythonically (I think!).

If I wasn't so strapped for time I'd have put the intro messages into a list as well and cycled through them that way. I had a LOT of fixing to do re things like camelCase, indentation, structuring, user input and so forth. A good exercise!

I think I could definitely make this more effective with the use of other modules and getting rid of the `while` statement but this is all I had time for.
