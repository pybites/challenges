#Pretty Table

For Challenge 11 I choose to create a dict containing a name (key) and a list of five digits. When you print out the 
dict there are two decorators. The first (pretty_table_header) takes in the number of columns (5) and prints out a 
header consisting of name, sum, and headers for each column. The other decorator (sum_numbers) takes the numbers for 
each key/value pair, sums it, and then add it at the beginning of the value list so the list is now number of 
columns + 1 long.
