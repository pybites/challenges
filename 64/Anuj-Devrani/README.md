## Code Challenge 64 - PyCon ES 2019 Marvel Challenge

I was excited with this challenge as it allows us to work on different skills. We had to take the role of developer, analyser, illustrator.

I started exploring the API, but soon it was clear to me that their API was very slow to make synchrous requests. So I started to experiment with the Python 3.7 Async capability. This challenge made me sit through the weekend to learn the async framework built in.

With the power of async I was able to quickly gather the dataset in minutes which would have taken hours. Considering the fact that their comics dataset has staggering 45514 records.

## Final Results
