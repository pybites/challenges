## PyQt5 Description
PyQt5 is described as(here: https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/):
> PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.

I was inspired to create the GUI by <a href="https://twitter.com/m_herrmann">@m_herrmann</a> article here: https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial

Currently, this is what I have as shown by the screenshot below.

Only two buttons with functionality(on click) currently. Dashboard Webview and Calculator Button

### To-dos
1. Link the GUI to a database/API
2. Create Login/Register functionality
3. Compile the app using a library called <a href="https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs">fbs</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/m_herrmann">@m_herrmann</a>
