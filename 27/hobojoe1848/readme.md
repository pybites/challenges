This is a super simple Flask app using PRAW.

As you'll see there are quite a few hardcoded aspects of the code. This was mainly due to time restraints.

The challenge was around using PRAW which I've done, I can come back later and make it more flexible and Pythonic with regards to specifying reddit subreddits etc.
