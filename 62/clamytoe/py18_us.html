Not only can they catch bugs and errors but they can contribute in positive ways to the individual developer, the team, management and company as a whole.  

Art critiques have existed in academia for hundreds of years. The methodology of the critique has evolved to be time sensitive and productive, while keeping the enthusiasm of the student artist intact.  

The purpose of the art critique is to get peers and mentors to look at the work and raise any problems they may see. It&#39;s also time where people with more experience could contribute their knowledge in a helpful way. This process is about producing the best work, quickly and in a productive and constructive way. 
 
These methods can be applied to code review.

It’s hard to guess how much money you’ll have to spend, how many attendees you’ll have, and what your new community will look like. With so many things to worry about, it’s no surprise that most events don’t prioritise outreach until they’ve got a few years under their belt, if at all.

It doesn’t have to be this way, and it can even be easier to build a new event around outreach and inclusion than it is to build it in later on!

This talk shares the story of North Bay Python’s inaugural conference, which we planned in under 6 months, ran on a $40,000 budget, and built a welcoming community to make it real. We made inclusivity a founding principle and did so without compromising our speaker lineup while still attracting great sponsorship and hosted an event that almost every attendee wants to return to.

In this talk, we’re going to share with you how we built a conference, from the ground up, to be as inclusive as we could make it. We’ll touch on early organisation, marketing, and on-the ground logistics. Throughout the talk, you’ll learn:

* How we designed a budget that let us prioritise outreach and inclusion activities
* How we built the community that we wanted before the conference even started
* How we ran an event that proved that we meant everything we said

You too can host a new conference with a great lineup on a shoestring budget and short timeline, and you can do it while being inclusive, welcoming, and putting attendee safety first. Find out how you can have your cake, eat it, and still have lots to share with your new community.

We know it&#39;s a bad practice and we always intend to put in place safer infrastructure before we need to do it again — what does a better system actually look like?

This talk progresses through 5 strategies for teams using a Python stack to do SQL writes against a database, to achieve increasing safety and auditability:

(1) Develop a process for raw SQL edits 
(2) Run scripts locally
(3) Deploy and run scripts on an existing server
(4) Use a task runner
(5) Build a Script Runner service

We’ll talk about the pros and cons of each strategy and help you determine which one is right for your specific needs.

By the end of this talk you’ll be ready to start upgrading your infrastructure for making changes to your production database safely!">Strategies to Edit Production Data</a>

It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. Armed with some best practices and a little help
from supporting libraries, timezone-related bugs can be a thing of the past.

This talk explores standard library and 3rd party library timezone support, as
well as persistence and serialization techniques for timezone-aware datetimes.

In Python, **behave** is one of the leading BDD test frameworks. Using **behave**, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:

&gt; Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed
&gt; When the user searches the phrase Python
&gt; Then search results for Python are shown

This talk will teach how to use **behave** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework. It will focus on the layers of the behave framework: feature files, step definitions, support classes, and config files. A full example project will be hosted on GitHub for audience members to reference after the talk.

Hear the story of how we used Python to build an AI that plays Super StreetFighter II on the Super NES. We&#39;ll cover how Python provided the key glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with `gym`, `keras-rl` and `tensorflow`. We&#39;ll show examples of game play and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the bot-v-bot tournament we ran. 

After this talk you&#39;ll know how easy it is to use Python and Python&#39;s machine learning libraries to teach a computer to play games.  You&#39;ll see a practical example of the same type of machine learning used by AlphaGo, and also get to find out which character in StreetFighter II is best to pick when playing your friends.

Maybe you’re struggling with funding or documentation? Or you just can’t find new contributors and you’re drowning in issues and pull requests?
Open Source is made up of many components and we are often better-trained in methods for writing good code, than in methods for succeeding in the other dimensions we want our project to grow. 
In this talk we’ll explore the different components of an Open Source project and how they work together. After this talk you’ll be well-equipped with a ideas and strategies for growing, cultivating, and nourishing your Open Source project. 

For your project to succeed, all of its non-code components must be well-maintained. What are these different components and what methods can we learn to maintain them?

* Build real relationships with your sponsors and determine ways how both sides can benefit from this relationship, don’t just ask people for money. 
* Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard. 
* Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes. 
* Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner. 
* Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.
* Implement a Code of Conduct and enforce it if needed: Make your project a safe space to contribute for everyone. 

With these methods and a half-dozen others, you’ll handle beautifully all the components your project needs to succeed.">Flourishing FLOSS: Making Your Project Successful</a>

EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.

EDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users. 

For end-users: 
A good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful.  
We must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.

For professionals:
How do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions.  EDA answers these questions explicitly.
Also, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.

In this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients. I will also discuss the risks of not mastering EDA and data visualization as a data scientist.">Trust the data to speak for itself</a>

The multiple layers of indirection also make it harder to debug things, especially when throwing the Pyspark wrapper into the equation.

With Dask emerging as a pure Python framework for parallel computing, Python developers might be looking at it with new hope, wondering if it might work for them in place of Spark. In this talk, I’m using a data aggregation example to highlight the important differences between the two frameworks, and make it clear how involved the switch may be.

CuPy is an open-source library with NumPy syntax that increases speed by doing matrix operations on NVIDIA GPUs. It is accelerated with the CUDA platform from NVIDIA and also uses CUDA-related libraries, including cuBLAS, cuDNN, cuRAND, cuSOLVER, cuSPARSE, and NCCL, to make full use of the GPU architecture. CuPy&#39;s interface is highly compatible with NumPy; in most cases it can be used as a drop-in replacement. CuPy supports various methods, data types, indexing, broadcasting, and more.

For most purposes using the python math module to create random numbers within a specific range can be done with no further questions, but sometimes we require a more nuanced implementation. 

We will look at both pseudo-random number generators, which use statistically repeatable processes to generate seemingly random series and true random number generators, which inject physical processes like atmospheric noise to generate sequences of numbers. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both approaches and common methods of implementing these two types of generators in python. 

Finally, we will look at several real applications for randomness and discuss the best method for generating “randomness” in each scenario. ">Randomness in Python: Controlled Chaos in an Ordered Machine</a>

Much of Apache Spark’s power comes from lazy evaluation along with intelligent pipelining, which can make debugging more challenging. This talk will examine how to debug Apache Spark applications, the different options for logging in PySpark, as well as some common errors and how to detect them.

Spark’s own internal logging can often be quite verbose, and this talk will examine how to effectively search logs from Apache Spark to spot common problems. In addition to the internal logging, this talk will look at options for logging from within our program itself.

Spark’s accumulators have gotten a bad rap because of how they interact in the event of cache misses or partial recomputes, but this talk will look at how to effectively use Spark’s current accumulators for debugging as well as a look to future for data property type accumulators which may be coming to Spark in future version.

In addition to reading logs, and instrumenting our program with accumulators, Spark’s UI can be of great help for quickly detecting certain types of problems.

Debuggers are a wonderful tool, however when you have 100 computers the “wonder” can be a bit more like “pain”. This talk will look at how to connect remote debuggers, but also remind you that it’s probably not the easiest path forward.

There’s probably nothing worse than that sinking feeling when you finish an analysis, email it to your manager or client to review, and they point out a mistake so basic you can’t even fathom how you missed it. 

This talk is about mine: how to take an average.

Averages are something we use everywhere - it’s a simple np.mean() in pandas or AVG() in SQL. But recently I’ve come to appreciate just how easy it is to calculate this statistic incorrectly. We learn once - in middle school no less - how to take an average, and never revisit it. Then, when we are faced with multidimensional datasets (ie. pretty much every dataset out there), we never reconsider whether we should be taking an average the same way.

In this talk, we follow my arduous and humbling journey of learning how to properly take an average with multidimensional data. We will cover how improperly calculating it can produce grossly incorrect figures, which can slip into publications, research analyses and management reports.">Analyzing Data: What pandas and SQL Taught Me About Taking an Average</a>

Tensorflow has its benefits like wide scale adoption, deployment on mobile, and support for distributed computing, but it also has a somewhat challenging learning curve, is difficult to debug, and hard to deploy in production. PyTorch is a new deep learning framework that solves a lot of those problems.

PyTorch is only in beta, but users are rapidly adopting this modular deep learning framework. PyTorch supports tensor computation and dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static graphs that are used in frameworks such as Tensorflow. PyTorch offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network and for many, is more intuitive to learn than Tensorflow.

This talk will objectively look at PyTorch and why it might be the best fit for your deep learning use case and we&#39;ll look at use cases that will showcase why you might want consider using Tensorflow instead.

But it also gives us an easy way to handle errors which is a hard task within asynchronous programming. ReactiveX makes our code more flexible, readable, maintainable and easy to write.

We will be exploring how ReactiveX help us to make things easier with its operators toolbox that can be used to filter, create, transform or unify any of those streams. We will learn that in just a few lines of maintainable code, we can have multiple web sockets which recieves multiple requests all handled by an asynchronous process that serves a filtered output.

To do that I decided to explain an example of the use with an example by implementing observables, observers/subscribers and subjects. We will start by requesting our data stream from the Github API with a Tornado web socket and then filtering and processing it asynchrounosly.">Reactive Programming with RxPy</a>

But *writing* concurrent programs is complicated, intimidating to newcomers, and often challenging even for experts.

Does it have to be? Python is famous for being simple and straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and straightforward too? I think so. By carefully analyzing usability pitfalls in other libraries, and taking advantage of new Python 3 features, I&#39;ve come up with a new set of primitives that make it dramatically easier to write correct concurrent programs, and implemented them in a new library called [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io). In this talk, I&#39;ll describe these primitives, and demonstrate how to use them to implement a basic algorithm for speeding up TCP connections. Compared to the best previous Python implementation, our version turns out to be easier to understand, more correct, and dramatically shorter.

This talk assumes basic familiarity with Python, but does *not* require any prior experience with concurrency, async/await, or networking.

Your host sent instructions describing how to reach their office. Though the instructions were fairly clear, in a few places, such as at the end, you had to infer what to do. How does a _robot (agent)_ interpret an instruction in the environment to infer the correct course of action? Enabling harmonious _Human - Robot Interaction_ is of primary importance if they are to work seamlessly alongside people.

Dealing with natural language instructions in hard because of two main reasons, first being, Humans - through their prior experience know how to interpret natural language but agents can’t, and second is overcoming the ambiguity that is inherently associated with natural language instructions. This talk is about how deep learning models were used to solve such complex and ambiguous problem of converting natural language instruction into its corresponding action sequence.

Following verbal route instructions requires knowledge of language, space, action and perception. In this talk I shall be presenting, a neural sequence-to-sequence model for direction following, a task that is essential to realize effective autonomous agents.

At a high level, a sequence-to- sequence model is an end-to-end model made up of two recurrent neural networks: 

 - **Encoder** - which takes the model’s input sequence as input and encodes it into a fixed-size context vector.
 - **Decoder** - which uses the context vector from above as a seed from which to generate an output sequence. 

For this reason, sequence-to-sequence models are often referred to as _encoder-decoder_ models. The alignment based encoder-decoder model would translate the natural language instructions into corresponding action sequences. This model does not assume any prior linguistic knowledge: syntactic, semantic or lexical. The model learns the meaning of every word, including object names, verbs, spatial relations as well as syntax and the compositional semantics of the language on its own.

In this talk, steps involved in pre-processing of data, training the model, testing the model and final simulation of the model in the virtual environment will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and trade-offs made while designing the model.">Listen, Attend, and Walk : Interpreting natural language navigational instructions</a>

In this talk, I hope to address the key components for building out end to end testing for data pipelines by borrowing concepts from how we test python web services. Just like how we want to check for healthy status codes from our API responses, we want to be able to check that a pipeline is working as expected given the correct inputs.

However, when making charts, customarily we are just re-sizing lines and circles based on metrics instead of creating data-driven version of reality.  The contemporary charting techniques have a few shortcomings (especially when dealing with high-dimensional dataset): 

* **Context Reduction**: in order to fit a high-dimensional dataset into a chart one needs to filter/ aggregate/ flatten data which results in reduction of full context of information.  Without context most of the charts show only a part of the story, that can potentially lead to data misinterpretation/misunderstanding. 
* **Numeric Thinking**: naturally humans have hard time perceiving big numbers. While data visualization is suppose to help us to conceptualize large volumes,  unless the dataset is carefully prepared, 2D charts rarely give us the intuitive grasp of magnitude. 
* **Perceptual de-humanization**: when examining charts it is easy to forget that we are dealing with activity in real world instead of lines/bars. 

Augmented/Mixed Reality can potentially solve all of the issues listed above by presenting an intuitive and interactive environment for data exploration. Three dimensional space provides conditions to create complex data stories with more “realistic assets” (beyond lines and bars). The talk would present the architecture required to create MR data visualization story with Python (70% of architecture), starting with drawing 3D assets in a data-driven way and finishing with deployment on MR devices.

We use this in practice to serve a broad community of atmospheric and climate scientists.

Atmospheric and climate scientists analyze large volumes of observational and simulated data to better understand our planet.  They have historically used tools like NumPy and SciPy along with Jupyter notebooks to combine efficient computation with accessibility.  However, as datasets increase in size and collaboration extends to new populations of scientists these tools begin to feel their age.  In this talk we use more recent libraries to build a modern deployment for academic scientists.  In particular we use the following tools:

- **Dask:** to parallelize and scale NumPy computations
- **XArray**: as a self-discribing data model and tool kit for labeled and index arrays
- **JupyterLab:** to enable more APIs for users beyond the classic notebook
- **JupyterHub:** to manage users and maintain environments for a new population of cloud-friendly users
- **Kubernetes:** to manage everything and deploy easily on cloud hardware

This talk will focus less on how these libraries work and will instead be a case study of using them together in an operational setting.  During the talk we will build up and deploy a running system that the audience can then use to access distributed computing resources.

Netflix must stream uninterrupted in the face of widespread network issues, bad code deploys, AWS service outages, and much more. Failovers make this possible.

Failover is the process of transferring all of our traffic from one region in AWS to another. While most of Netflix runs on Java, failovers are powered entirely by Python. Python&#39;s versatility and rich ecosystem means we can use it for everything from predicting our traffic patterns to orchestrating traffic movement, while dealing with the eventual consistency of AWS.

Today, we can shift all of our 100 million+ users in under seven minutes. A lot of engineering work went into making this possible. The issues we faced and solutions we created have broad application to availability strategies in the cloud or the datacenter.">How Netflix does failovers in 7 minutes flat</a>

In 2001, I wrote Python versions of these tools which can be found in the PLY project.  PLY predates a huge number of modern Python features including the iteration protocol, generators, decorators, metaclasses, and more.  As such, it relied on a variety of clever hacks to layer a domain specific parser specification language on top of Python itself. 

In this talk, I discuss a modernization of the PLY project that abandons its past and freely abuses modern Python features including advanced metaclasses, guaranteed dictionary ordering, class decorators, type hints, and more.   The result of this work can be found in the SLY project.  However, this talk isn&#39;t so much about SLY as it is focused on how far you can push Python metaprogramming features to create domain-specific languages.   Prepare to be horrified--and to write code that will break your IDE.

Every friend or page liked on Facebook, each connection in LinkedIn or Twitter account followed is a new relationship not only between two people, but also between their data. In Brazil only, we have 160 millions Facebook users. How can we represent and manipulate all these relationships? Graph Databases are storage systems that use graph structure (nodes and edges) to represent and store data in a semantic way.

This talk will begin approaching the challenge in representing relationships in Relational Databases and introducing a more friendly solution using graph. The definition of Graph Database, its pros and cons and some available tools (Neo4J, OrientDB and TitanDB) will be shown during the presentation, as well as how these tools can be integrated with Python.

I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities.  A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian *non-parametric* methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python, using the PyMC3 package. Specifically, I will introduce two common types, Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and show how they can be applied easily to real-world problems using two examples."> Bayesian Non-parametric Models for Data Science using PyMC3</a>

This is a tale of long-winded rants, spectacular sideburns, and gentlemen scientists behaving badly. It is also a lesson about the importance of honest reflection in technical teamwork. Lilly outlines some of the mistakes made during one of the biggest tech delivery projects in history, and how a constructive view of failure helped to turn it all around.

It will become an essential part of every Python programmer&#39;s toolkit.  This talk shows what problem the module solves, explains its key design decisions, and provides practical examples of how to put it to work.

Dataclasses are shown to be the next step in a progression of data aggregation tools: tuple, dict, simple class, bunch recipe, named tuples, records, attrs, and then dataclasses. Each builds upon the one that came before, adding expressiveness at the expense of complexity.

Dataclasses are unique in that they let you selectively turn-on or turn-off its various capabilities and it lets the user choose the underlying data store (either instance dictionary, instance slots, or an inherited base class).

Dataclasses and typing.NamedTuple both use variable annotations which were new in Python 3.6.

But how do we automate a device remotely? The answer is Appium.

We talk a lot about building resilient systems, but all systems are (at least for now) built by humans. Humans who have been making the same types of mistakes for thousands of years. 

Just because failure happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your system. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential.

This talk distills 3000 pages of failure research into 40 minutes of knowledge about the human factors of failure, how it can be recognised, and how you can work around it to create more resilient systems.

By the end of this talk the audience will have an awareness of the most common psychological reasons for mistakes and failures and how to develop systems and processes to protect against them.">The human nature of failure &amp; resiliency</a>

Performance bottlenecks aren’t always intuitive or easy to spot by reading code so we need to collect data with [profiling](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html). Once we’ve identified the bottleneck we’ll need to change our approach, but what options are faster than others?

This talk illustrates a Python performance investigation and improvements using an [Advent of Code](http://www.adventofcode.com/) programming challenge. I’ll walk through starting from a slow (but correct) solution, look at profiling data to investigate _why_ it’s slow, and explore multiple paths for improving performance, including more efficient algorithms and using third-party tools like [Cython](http://cython.org/). You’ll leave this talk with a recipe for analyzing Python performance and information about some options for improved performance.">Python Performance Investigation by Example</a>

Think test data files, certificates, templates, translation catalogs, and other static files you want to access from Python code.  Sometimes you put these static files in a package directory within your source tree, and then locate them by importing the package and using its `__file__` attribute.  But this doesn&#39;t work for zip files!

You could use `pkg_resources`, an API that comes with `setuptools` and hides the differences between files on the file system and files in a zip file.  This is great because you don&#39;t have to use `__file__`, but it&#39;s not so great because `pkg_resources` is a big library and can have potentially severe performance problems, even at import time.

Welcome to `importlib.resources`, a new module and API in Python 3.7 that is also available as a standalone library for older versions of Python.  `importlib.resources` is build on top of Python&#39;s existing import system, so it is very efficient.  It also defines an abstract base class which loaders can implement to provide their own resource access.  Python&#39;s built-in zipimporter uses this to provide efficient access to resources within a zip file.  Third party import hooks can do the same, so resources can come from anything that is importable by Python.

This talk will step through the motivations behind `importlib.resources`, the library&#39;s usage, its interfaces, and the hooks made available to third party packages.  It will also talk about the minor differences between the standalone version and the version in Python 3.7&#39;s standard library.  Hopefully audience members will come away with compelling reasons to port their code to this much more efficient library.">Get your resources faster, with importlib.resources</a>

Measured in Internet time, it is ancient. The oldest main stream implementation of the WSGI specification is mod_wsgi, for the Apache HTTPD server and it is over 10 years old.

WSGI is starting to be regarded as not up to the job, with technologies such as HTTP/2, web sockets and async dispatching being the way forward. Reality is that WSGI will be around for quite some time yet and for the majority of use cases is more than adequate.

The real problem is not that we need to move to these new technologies, but that we aren&#39;t using the current WSGI servers to their best advantage. Moving to a new set of technologies will not necessarily make things better and will only create a new set of problems you have to solve.

As one of the oldest WSGI server implementations, Apache and mod\_wsgi may be regarded as boring and not cool, but it is still the most stable option for hosting WSGI applications available. It also hasn&#39;t been sitting still, with a considerable amount of development work being done on mod\_wsgi in the last few years to make it even more robust and easier to use in a development environment as well as production, including in containerised environments.

In this talk you will learn about many features of mod\_wsgi which you probably didn&#39;t even know existed, features which can help towards ensuring your Python web application deployment performs to its best, is secure, and has a low maintenance burden.

Topics which will be covered include:

* Easy deployment of Python web applications using mod\_wsgi-express.
* Integration of mod_wsgi-express with a Django web application.
* Using mod\_wsgi-express in a development environment.
* How to make use of mod\_wsgi-express in a production environment.
* Using mod_wsgi-express in a containerised runtime environment.
* Ensuring consistency between development and production environments using warpdrive.
* Using mod\_wsgi-express to bootstrap a system Apache installation for hosting WSGI applications.
* Why you should be using daemon mode of mod\_wsgi and not embedded mode.
* How to properly associate mod\_wsgi with a Python virtual environment.
* Building a robust deployment that can recover from misbehaving application code, backend services, or request overloading.
* Using hooks provided by mod\_wsgi to monitor the performance of your Python web application.

If you are a beginner, come learn why mod\_wsgi is still a good option for deploying your Python web applications. If you are an old time user of mod\_wsgi, find out about all the features you probably didn&#39;t know existed, revisit your current Python web application deployment and make it even better.">Secrets of a WSGI master.</a>

But how exactly do you deploy properly on Linux? Wonder no more! In 30 minutes, this talk explains how you can harness the power of the init system and systemd to solve common deployment problems, including some that you didn&#39;t even know you had. Examples of things we will cover:

* How to secure your system by having: private /tmp for your process, read-only paths so that your process can not write to them, inaccessible paths, protect users home, network access, bin directories, etc.
* How to limit the resources you app can consume.
* How to interact directly with systemd, so it can start transient units, start/stop services, mount disks, resolve addresses.
* How to isolate your service without containers.
* How to isolate your service using containers (using systemd to spawn a namespace).

All this will be covered from a Python developer&#39;s perspective.

You&#39;ll also learn why that isn&#39;t such a great idea after all and how we ended up extending the garbage collector API which allowed us to (mostly) re-enable garbage collection. We&#39;ll discuss our upstream contributions to the garbage collector that landed in Python 3.6 and 3.7.

Unfortunately, they are usually an under-estimated part of the development process.

This talk aims to transmit the need for the logging module, briefly explains how to use it and how it is built, and dives into all the complexity that is hidden to us. This will help attendees not just understand all the magic that allows us to inspect our applications at runtime, but also to avoid mistakes and adapt the module to our needs for more esoteric scenarios.

The talk is structured to simplify the understanding of the logging module. Many people have read the documentation, but still struggle to fully understand what is happening under the hood. This talk aims to eliminate that barrier by presenting it in an easier-to-digest manner.

Companies like Dropbox and Facebook, and open-source projects like Zulip, use static types (with [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)) to make Python more productive and fun to work with — in existing codebases from 40k lines to 4 million, in Python 2 and 3, and while preserving the conciseness and flexibility that make Python a great language in the first place. I’ll describe how.

Reading and understanding code is a huge part of what we do as software developers. If we make it easier to understand our codebases, we make everyone more productive, help each other write fewer bugs, and lower barriers for new contributors. That&#39;s why Python now features optional static types, and why Dropbox, [Facebook](https://engineering.instagram.com/let-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881), and [Zulip](https://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/) use them on part or all of their Python code.

In this talk, I’ll share lessons from Zulip’s and Dropbox’s experience — having led the mypy team at Dropbox and working now on the Zulip core team — for how you can start using static types in your own codebases, large or small. We’ll discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project’s tooling; what order to approach things in; and powerful new tools that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before.

My path to recommenders has been an unusual one: from a Software Engineer to working on matching algorithms at a dating company, with a little background on machine learning. With my knowledge of Python and the use of basic SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) frameworks, I was able to understand SVDs from a practical standpoint of what you can do with them, instead of focusing on the science.

In my talk, you will learn 2 practical ways of generating recommendations using SVDs: matrix factorization and item similarity. We will be learning the high-level components of SVD the doer way: we will be implementing a simple movie recommendation engine with the help of Jupiter notebooks, the MovieLens database, and the Surprise recommendation package.

In this talk, I&#39;ll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.

You can understand Big-O even if you aren&#39;t a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn&#39;t as mystical as it appears. It&#39;s wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn&#39;t have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.

On top of the general design, there are many code quality aspects that you need to watch out for when writing and reviewing code such as adherence to PEP8, docstring quality, test quality, etc. Furthermore, everyone is human. If you are catching these code quality issues by hand, there is a good chance that at some point you will miss an easy opportunity to improve code quality. If the quality check can be done by a machine, then why would you even try to catch the code quality issue by hand? In the end, the machine will be able to perform the quality check with much more speed, accuracy, and consistency than a person.

This talk will dive into how existing open source projects offload and automate many of these code quality checks resulting in:

- A higher quality and a more consistent codebase
- Maintainers being able to focus more on the higher level design and interfaces
  of a project.
- An improved contribution process and higher quality pull requests from
  external contributors

By diving into how these open source projects automate code quality checks, you will learn about:

- The available tooling related to checking code quality such as `flake8`,
  `pylint`, `coverage`, etc.
- How to automate code quality checks for both a development and team 
  setting.
- First-hand accounts of the benefits and lessons learned from automating
  code quality checks in real-life open source projects.

In this talk, I&#39;ll discuss how to take a type checker, bolt on an interprocedural static analyzer, and delight your security team with high quality results.

Abstract 

It is incredibly challenging to build a halfway decent static analysis tool for a dynamic language like Python. Fortunately, it gets quite a bit easier with Python type annotations. To explain why, I&#39;ll present a tool that finds security vulnerabilities by tracking dangerous flows of information interprocedurally across an entire codebase. **Then,** I&#39;ll demonstrate how that tool is really just a slightly slower, more sophisticated, type checker.
