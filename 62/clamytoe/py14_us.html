                    <h4>Lynn Root in Systems Administration</h4>
                    You&#39;ve deployed! But your friends can&#39;t see it - what&#39;s wrong? I&#39;m betting DNS.  Maybe you&#39;ve fixed a couple of entries, point some records to hostnames, waited patiently for new domains to resolve only to notice your nameservers are incorrect.  But what actually goes on with DNS? Come to this talk to find out how DNS works, and how to interact and create a DNS with Python.

                    <h4>Brandon Rhodes in Best Practices &amp; Patterns</h4>
                    Why are Python programmers crazy about lists and dictionaries, when
other languages tout bitmaps, linked lists, and B+ trees? Are we missing
out? Come learn how data structures are implemented on bare metal, how
to select the right data structure, how the list and dictionary cover a
wide swath of use cases, and when to dip into the Standard Library or a
third-party package for an alternative.

                    Did you know that when you resolve a hostname, you can get multiple addresses back, and pick any one to connect to? Some of these addresses will connect near instantly, while others might take a long time or time out. This talk is about a Twisted endpoint API I built that takes a hostname, and returns the connection that takes the least time to complete, from the list of resolved host addresses.

We&#39;ll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just a &quot;pip install&quot; away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.

                    Blinking colored lights bring out the child in all of us. Color LED lighting technology is becoming more available and affordable. Layers of hardware, lighting protocols, and effects design can make doing anything more complex than blinking these lights tricky. Come learn about LEDs how to control them with Python, and about building real-time control of physical things.

Finally, we&#39;ll discuss how the async model of Tulip/PEP3156 is the ultimate API. The future is bright!

                    One of the great features of Python is its machine learning capabilities. Scikit is a rich Python package which allows developers to create predictive apps.  In this presentation, we will guess what type of music do Python programmers like to listen to, using Scikit and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm.

                    Sometimes, the code you need just isn&#39;t available in Python, but someone&#39;s written some code in another language that solves your problem. What options do you have for interacting with this external code from within your program? We&#39;ll examine how to call external binaries, what happens behind the scenes at a systems level, and how these implementation details affect performance and memory usage. In the second part of the talk, we&#39;ll discuss the different options for more tightly integrating external code in the form of a C library for better performance and control.

                    <h4>Kevin Ballard in Best Practices &amp; Patterns</h4>
                    Taba is a distributed metrics aggregator, similar in concept to statsd. Built with Python using Redis, gevent, and Cython, it currently handles over 6M events/sec with strong consistency guarantees. This talk will present an overview of its design, and discuss the challenges and solutions encountered in the process of building a high throughput, low latency distributed service.

                    Python includes a powerful debugger, but using it well requires practice. Setting a break point and inspecting local variables is easy, but what else can you do? What if you need to set the breakpoint
in one of your dependencies, or only fire it conditionally? How do you navigate calls, or change them? Join me for an in depth look at how you can better use PDB to debug and understand programs.

                    Guaranteed behavior makes software modules useful. Software guarantees are commonly incomplete with good reason: promises that are narrow and few are most easily kept across wide ranges of platforms and long times. We define the space of a module’s allowed behavior to be its “behavioral envelope” and show that thinking and speaking in terms of envelopes eases maintenance and makes APIs delightful.

                    To many developers the database is a black box. You expect to be able to put data into your database, have it to stay there, and get it out when you query it... hopefully in a performant manner. When its not performant enough the two options are usually add some indexes or throw some hardware at it. We&#39;ll walk through a bit of a clearer guide of how you can understand and manage DB performance.
