                    Machine learning is a crucial part of modern software development. Libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, gensim, and Theano help developers build projects that were previously impossible, and these applications empower our users and can make fundamental improvements in daily life. This talk will show you the why, what, and how of machine learning in Python.

Why is communicating about security issues so painful? More importantly: how can we do all of these things better?

This talk will show you the best ways to use functions in Python: when *args is helpful and when it&#39;ll crash your programs; how to use generators for arguments and return values; the value of keyword vs. keyword-only arguments; and more!

This talk will show you that you can make your code be Python 2/3 source-compatible using various tools to pick up the nitty-gritty work and help modernize your Python code to newer Python 2 practices.

                    <h4>Jake VanderPlas in Science</h4>
                    NumPy, the core array computing library for Python, provides tools for flexible and powerful data analysis, and is the basis for most scientific code written in Python. Getting the most out of NumPy, though, might require slightly changing how you think about writing code: this talk will outline the basic strategies essential to performing fast numerical computations in Python with NumPy.

                    As frontend web frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone.js take over, is Python on the server destined to be demoted to a basic REST interface? If we embrace our new JavaScript overlords, how do we ensure Python is best positioned for this new world of REST on the server?

                    In a highly dynamic language like Python, testing is even more critical than in compiled or more static languages. Like any other code we produce, tests can be either good or bad. This talk explores three fallacies of testing, and the mistakes and bad habits these fallacies encourage; and shows how to write good tests which help assure proper behavior without impeding development progress.

                    <h4>Andrew T. Baker in Systems Administration</h4>
                    Docker was one of last year’s most talked about open source projects - but what is it? And what does it mean for deploying applications? This talk will explain what Docker is and where it fits in with other deployment techniques. Attendees will learn the fundamentals of Docker, see some practical examples of how Docker is used, and consider if Docker could be a useful addition to their platform.

                    The behavior of names and values in Python can be confusing. Like many parts of Python, it has an underlying simplicity that can be hard to discern, especially if you are used to other programming languages. Here I&#39;ll explain how it all works, and present some facts and myths along the way.  Call-by-reference? Call-by-value? The answer will be clear!

                    Software is maintained by humans with limited memory and an unfortunate tendency to make mistakes. Test-driven development (TDD) can help you work around these design flaws by providing a permanent, automated specification for your code. Learn how to implement TDD when bug fixing and implementing new features and how this process will ensure your code is correct both now and in the future.

                    Continuos Deployment is the act of deploying software constantly.  The idea is if &quot;release early, release often&quot; is good, releasing very often is better.  It&#39;s not trivial.   Automation is part of the battle, and testing is another.   Learn to use tools like Jenkins and Ansible to move from deploying software once a month to 15 times every hour, and why you&#39;ll want to.

                    The Python library uses descriptors frequently, but most developers overlook this feature. This talk will cover what a descriptor is, the current uses in the standard library, and how custom descriptors can be used in a developer’s toolset to eliminate repeated code.

In this talk you&#39;ll learn how to run end-to-end tests on your client and server web libraries using a tool called dpxdt. I&#39;ll also show how you can combine it with web-based diff tools like &quot;git webdiff&quot; to quickly and confidently iterate on web tools.

                    Creating and using models from a graph database can be quite different to the ones used for row/column/document-oriented databases, in the sense that the same query patterns could differ significantly in structure and performance. This session will present how to create models in Python for Titan property graphs, that allow you to manipulate graphs as if you were querying with Gremlin DSL.

                    Python string operations are profligate in their use of memory — the steps necessary to parse an HTTP request often make four or five copies of every incoming byte. But does it matter? This talk explores the “bytearray”, shows how its proper use dramatically reduces copying, but then uses metrics and visualizations to determine whether any increase in performance is worth the added complexity.

                    Four years after the Arab Spring &amp; 2 years after Snowden, little has changed. What now? This talk will remember Telecomix, an ad-hoc activist cluster that supported free communication around the world. Stories of humans and machines, reflection on 3 years of hacktivism &amp; exploration of similarities to the free software community. It follows a 2011 Pycon lightning talk given after Tahrir Square.

                    <h4>Andrew Montalenti in Python Libraries</h4>
                    Real-time streams are everywhere, but does Python have a good way of processing them? Until recently, there were no good options. A new open source project, streamparse, makes working with real-time data streams easy for Pythonistas. If you have ever wondered how to process 10,000 data tuples per second with Python -- while maintaining high availability and low latency -- this talk is for you.

                    Interactive data visualization libraries are mostly a JavaScript stronghold. The new Python library, Bokeh, provides a simple, clean way to make more shiny things. Although it comes from the data science community, it has a lot to offer web developers. For a visualization you might have built in d3.js, I&#39;ll show how to build it in Bokeh, how to test it, and how to hook it into your web app.

In this talk I’ll go over what the threat is and how you might be making yourself vulnerable. I’ll cover the features (not bugs: features) of XML, YAML, and JSON that make them surprisingly dangerous, and how to protect your code from them.
