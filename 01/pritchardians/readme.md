To keep it simple we don't accept pull-requests at this time. Just fork our repo and work on your solution locally.

To have the tests pass import the right module, do this when you have a local clone of the fork:
```
$ cd <challenge_number> (this week = 01)
$ cp name-template name.py
# code ...
```
If you want to share your solution just share your commit link in the comments of our Friday review post. 
(Monday post = questions / Friday post = solutions + reflection).

Check this link how to keep your fork in sync with our repo.

Remember, we don't strive for the 'best' solution, it's not a competition. We do of course strive to have 
good Pythonic solutions so any feedback is welcome, but do respect the newby / learner. 
Again, learning more + better Python is the main objective.

Finally we believe fixing code challenges is a very effective way to become a better programmer.

This week you will write a script to calculate the (language) dictionary word that would have the most value 
in Scrabble.

Read in dictionary.txt (a copy of /usr/share/dict/words on my Mac) and calculate the word that has the 
most value in Scrabble based on LETTER_SCORES which is imported in wordvalue-template.py.
